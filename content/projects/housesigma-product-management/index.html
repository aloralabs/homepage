                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>A common problem for software organizations looking to deploy on Linux is dealing with the dozens of different versions and distributions. Banana Accounting was no different in this regard. They had heard about <a href="https://snapcraft.io/">Snaps</a> as a possible solution to their problem but past attempts to bundle their existing software had not been successful.</p>
