                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>HouseSigma had become quite popular in the GTA and was looking to expand their offering across Canada. Their existing platform had served them well up until that point but was outdated and needed to be improved.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-5 order-lg-1">
        <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
        <p>Extensive user research was completed to reveal opportunities to improve the platform. An intentional decision was made to not be a "feature factory" but rather an OKR-driven team that builds solutions to solve customer problems. Features were prioritized and a roadmap was created to deliver value to users by shipping often. 
        </p>
        <p>The entire platform was overhauled, including the <a href="https://housesigma.com/" target="_blank">web platform</a>  along with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/housesigma-canada-real-estate/id1255490256" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.housesigma.android&hl=en_CA&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a> apps.</p>
