                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1992, SPC had been helping students save money for decades. By flashing a plastic membership, students could save at their favourite retailers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Every year, students would need to purchase a new card, if they remembered to. Once purchased, they would also need to remember to bring it with them shopping.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
        <p>User research and competitor analysis was performed to uncover potential opportunities and to understand the value proposition compared to competitors. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Goals were definied for the business and from there, a Product Strategy and Roadmap was created outlining the plan to get there.

        <h2 class="h3">Results</h2>
        <p>
            Taking a mobile-first approach, the business was transformed to a fully digital subscription-based business with a new payment processor and revamped user experience.
        </p>
        <p>The entire platform was overhauled to reflect the new business model, including the <a href="https://www.spccard.ca/" target="_blank">web platform</a>  along with <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/spc-student-savings/id716091998" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.spc.app&hl=en_CA&gl=US" target="_blank">Android</a> apps.</p>
