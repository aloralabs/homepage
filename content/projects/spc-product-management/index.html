                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Founded in 1992, SPC had been helping students save money for decades. By flashing a plastic membership, students could save at their favourite retailers. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Every year, students would need to purchase a new card, if they remembered to. Once purchased, they would also need to remember to bring it with them shopping.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
        <p>Extensive user research was completed to reveal opportunities to improve the platform. An intentional decision was made to not be a "feature factory" and pump out features for the sake of it but rather to be an OKR-driven team that builds solutions to solve customer problems. Features were prioritized and a roadmap was created to deliver value to users by shipping often.
