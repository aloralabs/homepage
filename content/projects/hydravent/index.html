                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Angelic Treasures had an outdated website that wasn't converting their traffic into booked calls. 
                </p>
                <p>The website was text-heavy and not mobile-optimized, creating a poor experience for their customers. <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank">Page Speed</a> plays a huge role on its performance and it scored an 11/100 on Mobile and 49/100 on Desktop.
                </p>

        {{< img src="atcd-website-design-development-mobile.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" >}}
    </div>
    <div class="col-lg-5 order-lg-1">
        <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
        <p>Diving deep into the data and understanding the customer was cruicual. Upon learning that the majority of their traffic uses mobile devices, a mobile-centric approach was taken to creating the design system.

        <h2 class="h3">Results</h2>
        <p>
            The website was redesigned and developed from the ground up, with the focus being primarily on UX and performance. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Now the <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank">Page Speed</a> score ranks 80/100 on Mobile and 98/100 on Desktop.
