                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Roster Point was bouncing around between freelancers and development agencies who were billing hours but accomplishing very little. They had been forced to take their site offline and users were becoming frustrated waiting for them to relaunch.</p>

        <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
        <p>Alora Labs introduced modern software development methodologies like automated testing, version control, continuous integration and agile project management.</p>
        <p>The client was understandable stressed about relaunching as soon as possible but we were able to balance the desire for features with the necessity to launch the site and provide a reliable and high quality experience.</p>
