                <h2 class="h3">The Problem</h2>
                <p>Having completed the development of the bathroom sensors, data was being collected with no means to effectively
                visualizing the data. As a stop-gap, they had resorted to using expensive off the shelf reporting software to
                demonstrate the concept to prospective customers and investors. </p><p>Our job was to find an alternative to licensing
                expensive vendor software, providing a more seamless user experience and re-architecturing their technology stack to
                allow them to scale to more customers.</p>

                {{< img src="iphonewhitelogin.png" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" >}}
            </div>
            <div class="col-lg-5 order-lg-1">
                <h2 class="h3">The Solution</h2>
                <p>It was necessary that an admin dashboard be developed where building managers and cleaning staff could collaborate on
                scheduling and optimize their time and resources.</p><p>We developed a custom web application for visualizing the data
                collected from the bathroom sensors and an interface for user management using the Laravel and Bootstrap framework.</p>
